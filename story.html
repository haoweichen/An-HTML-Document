            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>Since my childhood days I have been attracted to the sound and visual effects of video games and movies often. Whenever I saw a cool animation or movie special effect, I would like to know how it was done. 
                In the computer lessons of junior high school I learned to make web pages. Back then the teacher taught us to use Microsoft FrontPage. Unlike other classmates I did not like to use built-in elements to 
                create web pages, I spent some time learning the syntax of Macromedia Flash and added some dynamic images as well as used different backgrounds to make the pages unique from others during the web page 
                creation process. From then on I started to write some programs in my spare time to realize some of my creative ideas. Even my father and many of my relatives are doctors and encouraged me to study 
                medicine, I chose Computer Science as my major in college after discussion with them on my passion of younger days and my recognition of the importance information would play in the future.</p>
