# An-HTML-Document

For this lab, we will create our first 3 HTML files!

This lab is unique in a major way: there is no node code this week!

The major concepts of this lab are:
* Making data-centered HTML Documents
    * Thinking in terms of describing our data, without care for the visual aspect
    *  Focusing on structure and semantical validity.
* Writing valid HTML
   * <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">Your HTML must be valid</a> or you will lose points on the assignment.
* Linking between pages
   * You will use a basic navigation structure (see below) on each page to link to all the pages you are writing.

<br><strong>Starting an HTML Document</strong></br>
Your HTML documents should start with the following format. This is a basic, valid, HTML document structure. Your content goes inside of the <code>body</code> tags.
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
