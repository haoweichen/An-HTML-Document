                <h2>HaoWei's Biography</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from the Department of <strong><a href = "http://csie.cgu.edu.tw/bin/home.php?Lang=en">Computer Science and Information Engineering at Chang Gung University (CGU)</a></strong> in Taiwan, where I accumulated some experience of cross-disciplinary collaboration. During my studies, apart from taking the courses in my specialization, I seized an opportunity to apply my knowledge to another discipline, biology. I took <strong>Employment of Hidden Markov Models to Create a Speedy Alignment Database of Virus Genes</strong> as my graduation project, which was mainly about employing the hidden Markov model (HMM) to annotate information of individual virus genes within a database required in the analysis of multiple sequence alignment. On top of practical application of my machinery-related knowledge and basic data mining techniques to solve problems, I also accumulated a great deal of cross-disciplinary knowledge through this collaborative experience.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation, with an interest in doing research and gaining more interdepartmental practicum and with the flourishing development of integration of computer technology and education, I joined as a full-time research assistant in a top-ranking research group, <strong><a href = "http://www.ntustmeg.net/index.asp">Mini Educational Game Group</a></strong>, at the <strong><a href = "http://www.gsas.ntust.edu.tw/home.php?Lang=en">Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Technology, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology</a></strong>. My main objective was to design digital game mechanisms for educational purposes, write game programs and investigate game- based learning (GBL). Additionally, I was simultaneously involved in developing several digital educational games. In addition to undergoing efficacy testing in educational contexts, our games were put through quantitative content and behavioral pattern analyses for additional evaluations. Ultimately, the objective was to determine whether our games could really be helpful as educational tools.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I have presented four academic publications related to games (please refer to my resume for further reference) as I have described in domestic and international conferences. Among these, the most interesting experience I have had was a project to develop an XML-based game maker, which is a tool allowing teachers to easily customize a “room escape” puzzle-solving game. What they need to do is to design a simple game script and to set up the image files and the simple XML language from the XML library we provide. Then a room escape puzzle game is completed, after which it can not only run on PC but also be transferred to mobile devices. The tool we developed was applied to various junior and senior high school classrooms throughout Taiwan. I visited several of these schools and instructed the teachers and students about how to use this tool to develop simple web games.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, I presented another game developed by Unity, a game development platform, in a subconference of IEEE, the International Conference on Learning Technologies and Learning Environments (LTLE). This time the game was intended to teach students about historical knowledge. Before then, research relevant to these game-based assessments on students’ historical knowledge seems to be rarely discussed.
                Through my investigations into players’ technology acceptance and flow state (the mental state of players’ immersion in a game), I’ve found that images, scenery and special effects can enhance players to get immersed in the game. Nevertheless, simply relying on artistic designs cannot fully elicit players’ immersive response. It is essential to incorporate algorithms to the programs to achieve further interactive and media effects. Hence, I expect to expand my knowledge of algorithms and learning new techniques to improve the delicacy and smoothness of my games.</p>
